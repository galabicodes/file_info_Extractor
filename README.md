# 📂 File Info Extractor

The File Info Extractor is a simple Python script that scans a specific folder and prints useful details about each file inside. This system helps you understand what's in your folders — size, creation time, and full path — at a glance.

## What It Does
Lists all files in a folder
For each file, it shows:
📄 File Name
📏 File Size (in bytes)
📅 Creation Time (human-readable)
📍 Full Path
## Why It Matters
Understanding file info is a basic skill in automation, security, and system design.
This tool can be used in bigger systems like:
File backup tools
Storage analysis tools
File cleaners or auditors
Forensics/logging systems
